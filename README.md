# Smart-Traffic-System-Management

Project Details:

Overview:

This project involves designing a Smart Traffic System using an STM32 microcontroller, with communication via UART and WiFi. The system will monitor traffic density using sensors and dynamically control traffic signals. Additionally, it will use RFID for priority access and WiFi (ESP8266) for cloud connectivity and remote monitoring.

Requirements:

Hardware Components:

1 -> STM32 Microcontroller (e.g., STM32F407VG)

2 -> ESP8266 WiFi Module (connected via UART to STM32)

3 -> RFID Reader (MFRC522) (connected via UART to STM32)

4 -> RFID Tags (for vehicle identification)

5 -> IR Sensors (for vehicle detection at intersections)

6 -> Ultrasonic Sensors (for measuring vehicle density)

7 -> LED Traffic Lights (Red, Yellow, Green, connected to GPIO pins)

8 -> Buzzer (for emergency alerts)

9 -> Power Supply (3.3V & 5V regulators, LiPo battery or adapter)

10 -> Jumper Wires & PCB Board (for circuit integration)

Software Tools:

STM32CubeIDE (for firmware development and debugging)
Keil MDK-ARM (optional, for additional debugging and optimization)
STM32CubeMX (for peripheral configuration and code generation)
FreeRTOS (for multitasking support, if needed)
Arduino IDE (for ESP8266 firmware, if required)

Mobile Application:

Either a custom mobile app for traffic monitoring or a cloud-based dashboard (via MQTT/Firebase)
Integration with Node-RED for data visualization (optional)

Functional Features:

Real-Time Traffic Monitoring – Detects vehicle density and adjusts signal timing dynamically.
RFID-Based Priority Access – Grants priority to emergency vehicles and VIPs.
WiFi Communication via UART – Sends traffic data to a cloud server for remote monitoring.
Manual Override – Authorities can remotely control signals via the mobile app.
Low-Power Operation – Efficient power management using STM32 low-power modes.
